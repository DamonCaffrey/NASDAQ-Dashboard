# NASDAQ-Tableau-Dashboard
This project aims to provide insights into the NASDAQ stock market by analyzing and visualizing daily stock prices of different companies. The project includes data preparation and cleaning using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, basic exploratory data analysis in MySQL, and a Tableau Public dashboard for interactive visualization.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is a combination of two sources. A portion of the data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/svaningelgem/nasdaq-daily-stock-prices), while the rest was web-scraped using Python's Beautiful Soup and Request libraries.

## Data Preparation

The data was prepared and cleaned using Python's NumPy and Pandas libraries. Data cleaning techniques such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and data normalization were applied to ensure the data quality.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed in MySQL to get insights into the data. Different queries were executed to retrieve and summarize data, calculate key metrics, and visualize trends.

## Tableau Public Dashboard

The Tableau Public dashboard provides interactive visualizations of stock prices and trends of different companies. Users can explore and compare the data, filter by date range and companies, and hover over data points to see more information.
